<h1>Why Are Cats Awesome?</h1>

<p>Listen, I don't know much about cats and I'm sure as hell not going to spend 4.5 hours researching their evolution, diet, and political affiliations (although, I assume "fascist" would be a safe bet).</p>
<P>All I'm saying is that they're tiny, adorable, independent creatures; full of life, meows and Fancy Feast© and they are indeed far superior to any other sentient being out there including God (if he exists)</P>
<p>See aforementioned superior being pictured below:</p>
